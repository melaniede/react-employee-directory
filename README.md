# react-employee-directory

### Description
The employee directory is built using React. The directory gives employees and managers the ability to view non-sensitive data about other employees. The application's UI is broken up into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

### Deployed Application

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

### Acceptance Criteria
```
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 
The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
